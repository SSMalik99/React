to get user info from database we also need login and logout option 
to maintain privacy and user dash board and other infomation:-

when we login into a website then we connect our info for a limited time 
and we also need a token to use info in that website so that we get access to our dashboard
to get the token we use jwt(Json Web token) library of javascript 
we also need a securuty key to use this token.

we can do this with the simple database(MonoDB),,,
But we prefer mongoose cause we can define database's collection and keyword means which type 
should be the keyword like string, number etc.

we can all these things in a same javascript file but we will prefer to use in moduler approach,

So first we need to install some npm pakages for this purpose

npm i express body-parser jsonwebtoken bcryptjs cors mongoose


bcryptjs is used to incript the password and other things
